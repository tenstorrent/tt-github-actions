# Example ignore-only configuration file for SPDX License Checker
#
# This file should ONLY contain "ignore" section with patterns for files/directories
# to skip during SPDX license checking.
#
# The standard license settings (allowed_licenses, license_for_new_files, etc.)
# are built into the action and cannot be overridden to ensure consistency
# across all Tenstorrent repositories.
#
# Usage: Create a file like this in your repository and reference it with the
#        ignore_config_file input parameter.

ignore:
  perform_check: no  # Don't check files matching patterns below
  include:

    - built/

    # File types to ignore
